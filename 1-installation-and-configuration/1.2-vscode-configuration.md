# Step-by-Step: Configure VSCode to Run Go Code (Assuming Go is Already Installed)

## 1. Install VSCode
Download and install VSCode from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## 2. Install the Go Extension for VSCode
- Open VSCode.
- Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
- Search for `Go` (by Go Team at Google) and click **Install**.

## 3. Configure Go Tools
- Open a Go file in VSCode.
- VSCode will install required Go tools (like `gopls`, `delve`, etc.).

## 4. Create and Run a Go File
- Create a new folder and open it in VSCode.
- Create a file named `main.go`:
    ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
    }
    ```
- Open the terminal in VSCode (`Ctrl+``).
- Run your code:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
